            <div class="static">
            This is a static element, nothing new. He likes to stay cosy.
            </div>

            <div class="relative">
            This is a relative element, still in the normal document flow but modifiable inside of it. 
            </div>

            <div class="absolute">
            This is an absolute element. This guy is very cool, he is a rebel that got out of the normal document flow.
            </div>

            <div class="fixed">
            This is a fixed element. Now he is an interesting one. He likes to stay visible on the flow yet fixes itself on the document.
            </div>

            <div class="sticky">
            This is a sticky element. An interesting hybrid between his brother relative and fixed, he as scrolled sticks to the top of the page.
